          The year 1975 saw the birth of what was a vision an idea of an
          organization, a Sisterhood that would cater to the needs of
          Latinas and the Universal Woman. Thanks to the tremendous strides
          made by our Seventeen Founding Mothers, this dream was realized
          and took form as the entity Lambda Theta Alpha Latin Sorority,
          Incorporated as the FIRST Latina sorority in the nation.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          More than 40 years later, we have seen the outcome of such an
          organization. Lambda Theta Alpha has contributed to the
          advancement of all people by helping to produce educated women of
          many races, ethnicities, and creeds. These women are political
          leaders, doctors, lawyers, teachers, accountants, and hold other
          influential positions. Lambda Theta Alpha has also paved the way
          for many other Latina organizations, which also strive to empower
          and educate the community. From 1975 to date, Lambda Theta Alpha
          has upheld its purpose and mission, each day realizing the
          Founders dream that it may serve as a quintessential trailblazer
          for all women.

          In the Fall of 2002, the Interested Ladies of Lambda Theta Alpha
          Latin Sorority, Inc. at Stony Brook University were officially
          recognized by the organization and in the Fall of 2003 the group
          was officially recognized by the Stony Brook University. From the
          time that the group was first formed until 2005, the interest
          group remained very involved in campus life, using their
          leadership positions to serve the Stony Brook community as well as
          the Long Island and New York City communities.

          In the Spring of 2006, Eighteen dedicated ladies began the journey
          towards becoming Founding Sisters of Lambda Theta Alpha Latin
          Sorority, Incorporated at Stony Brook University. Their patience,
          characters, and motivation were tested, but they prevailed
          stronger than ever. Their dreams were realized. The fruits of all
          their labor, dedication, and sacrifice matured as four years of
          dreaming finally became their reality with the formation and
          establishment of the DELTA ZETA CHAPTER at Stony Brook University.
