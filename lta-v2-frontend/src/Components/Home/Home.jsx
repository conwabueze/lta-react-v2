                        Since our establishment in 1975, Lambda Theta Alpha Latin
                        Sorority, Incorporated has strived to empower women from all
                        cultures as well as make noteworthy contributions to our
                        communities. Today, our organization accomplishes this while
                        upholding a sisterhood based on Unity, Love, and Respect. We
                        develop strong leaders who provide and practice political, social,
                        and cultural activities. We also promote Latino unity through
                        charitable and educational programs to maintain a higher standard
                        of learning. Delta Zeta has been dedicated to carrying out our
                        mission since itâ€™s establishment in 2006. Feel free to browse
